## HackGT Project: (project name)

#### Build a platform that helps restaurants
Aligns with the NCR Sponsorship Challenge maybe

### Functionality:
1. 
1. encrypted user sign-in/sign-up
2. users can upload up to 15 receipts at once
3. OCR to scan and read receipts and store information in a database
4. cross checks with a pre-existing database to figure out type of purchase
5. presents the information in the database in a user-friendly way
6. allows for the user to set a budget for specific brands/types of purchases (since people most likely wouldn't upload frequently, we wouldn't have any way to track/stop people from going over their budget)
7. stores (?) receipts for future viewing – can be deleted if no longer necessary


### API:
1. catalog service: farmers can use this feature to create a list of all the produce they're growing (includes item availability)
2. delivery partner interface: restaurants can use this feature to create a new delivery 


### Applications
1. easier for companies to reimburse people on business travels (just add a date criteria)
2. track personal spending habits and set goals
3. come up with more

### Questions we need to answer:
1. how is this app different from, say, BoA's spending and budgeting system? what does this system allow for that the BoA system couldn't?
2. how are we ensuring privacy/encryption?
3. what about online transactions like venmo or paypal? is there a way we can add that info to this system?
4. can the OCR read both paper and electronic receipts?
5. what's next? how might you add to this project if you had more time/resources/will to work?

## HackGT Ideas

3. "toolkit" web app where contributers can share projects that have helped students in online classes (tech has smt like this, for instance)
4. a platform that helps teachers unionize virtually and negotiate for better __________________ (whatever it is they need)
5. better honorlock oop

### Health

### Politics/Elections (because why not)
1. platform that keeps track of election events (town halls, debates, primaries, etc.)

### Sustainability
1. find the nearest trash can/recycling bin/composting space
2. informs people of nearby climate advocacy groups/protests that they can join
3. platform that hosts crowdfunding ventures for all sustainable/environment centered initiatives (save the tigers, clean up the ocean, hurricane relief, etc.)
4. student/workpace-friendly pdf editor that reduces paper consumption in schools and offices

### Finance and Banking
1. encryption service for sensitive banking data
2. platform where users can upload receipts and send to companies for business trips to be reimbursed (probably exists already)
3. platform where users can upload receipts to keep track of how much money they spend where (comprehensively analyzes spending habits) (*Capital One*) 

### Travel
1. "throw a dart to pick your next destination" but online – randomly picks your next travel destination
2. set paramaters (budget, "bucket list destinations", type of vacation wanted, etc.) and the platform will find the next travel location for you
3. itinerary generator
4. some kind of safety app/site for single travelers - connect them with the right people when they need help

### Restaurants
1. making restaurant websites mobile-friendly
2. mobile paying
3. platform to connect restaurants and local gardeners (*NCR*)

### Personal Development/Self-Care
1. online journaling platform where you can add things like diary entries, upcoming events, mood trackers, and so on
