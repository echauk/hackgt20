## HackGT Project: (project name)

#### Build a platform that helps restaurants
Aligns with the NCR Sponsorship Challenge maybe

### Problem Statements
1. Help Small Businesses thrive - Local restaurants are connected with farmers to receive higher quality, fresher food. Thrive = 
2. Help restaurants and grocery stores handle a surge in online orders - Restaurants can use website to find farmers to get more food from in case they don't have enough for surge in online orders 

### Functionality:
#### Page 1
1. encrypted user sign-in/sign-up (and bout/contact us sections)
#### Page 2
2. food offerings organized by farmer distance 
3. search for specific foods, location/proximity, food categories
#### Page 3
4. checkout through third-party payment (venmo)
5. order tracking through delivery company 


### API:
1. catalog service: farmers can use this feature to create a list of all the produce they're growing (includes item availability)
2. delivery partner interface: restaurants can use this feature to create a new delivery 


### Applications
1. easier for companies to reimburse people on business travels (just add a date criteria)
2. track personal spending habits and set goals
3. come up with more

### Questions we need to answer:
1. how is this app different from, say, BoA's spending and budgeting system? what does this system allow for that the BoA system couldn't?
2. how are we ensuring privacy/encryption?
3. what about online transactions like venmo or paypal? is there a way we can add that info to this system?
4. can the OCR read both paper and electronic receipts?
5. what's next? how might you add to this project if you had more time/resources/will to work?
