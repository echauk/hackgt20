### Introduce ourselves - Yesha Thakkar, Eshani Chauk, and Rahul Deshpande

### Eshani 
We're excited to present Produce Pals, the perfect one-stop platform for small restaurants to buy fresh, high-quality local foods. 

### Yesha
We focused on two main goals: helping Small Businesses thrive and helping restaurants and grocery stores handle surges in online orders. We see local businesses thriving with better foods as a result of their connections with local farmers because they will have more access to healthier and fresher ingredients. When restaurants or grocery stores experience large increases in orders, they can turn to Produce Pals to find local farmers to provide additional produce. 

### Rahul
Upon arriving on the Produce Pals website, the user will be prompted to log in to an existing account or create a new account. When they create a new one, they are required to specify if they are a restaurant or a local farmer. After signing in, the user is taken to the main home page where farmers are sorted by proximity. Restaurants can access a search feature that filters farmers by produce type, name, location, and price.

### Eshani
Each farmer is required to have their own catalog of produce for the restaurants to browse through, which can be updated daily. The user clicks on Produce Forever Farms and is taken to their current catalog. There, they decide to purchase pumpkins for their restaurant. When the user clicks on Add to Shopping Cart, their current cart displays the farm name, item, quantity, price, and any comments. Right now, there are only pumpkins in this user’s cart, but they can click Keep shopping to add more. 

### Rahul
Now that the user is back on Produce Forever Farm’s page, they choose to buy apples. Their shopping cart is updated and they can add or subtract as many apples as they want. The user could either go back to Produce Forever’s page or the general home page for all farmers, but they are done with their purchases and want to proceed to checkout. For the most secure transaction, Venmo is used for money transfers between restaurants and farmers. 

### Yesha
In the future, we would like to create our own encrypted and secure payment system within the platform. Additionally, we want to implement our own delivery system between customers that is guaranteed to be safe. Thank you for your time and support!
