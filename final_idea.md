## HackGT Project: (project name)

#### Build a platform that helps local restaurants connect to local farmers
Aligns with the NCR Sponsorship Challenge 

### Problem Statements
1. Help Small Businesses thrive - Local restaurants are connected with farmers to receive higher quality, fresher food. Thrive = 
2. Help restaurants and grocery stores handle a surge in online orders - Restaurants can use website to find farmers to get more food from in case they don't have enough for surge in online orders 

### Functionality:
#### Page 1
1. encrypted user sign-in/sign-up (and bout/contact us sections)
#### Page 2
2. food offerings organized by farmer distance 
3. search for specific foods, location/proximity, food categories
#### Page 3
4. checkout through third-party payment (venmo)
5. order tracking through delivery company 

### NCR Technologies: 
1. NCR Design System used in Figma to design the website layout
2. Business Services Platform used to create a catalog and handle orders and deliveries through Catalog Service, Order, and Delivery Partner Interface


### Applications
1. easier for local restaurants to find fresher, healthier, and higher quality foods to improve their menu and support local farmers
2. one place to find, buy, and track orders 

### Questions we need to answer:
1. how are we ensuring privacy/encryption?
2. what about online transactions like venmo or paypal? is there a way we can add that info to this system?
3. how do the order tracking and payment systems work?
4. why would restaurants want to pay more for local produce if they can buy it in bulk from other places?
5. what's next? how might you add to this project if you had more time/resources/will to work?
6. add some more!
